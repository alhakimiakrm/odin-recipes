   <p> Here are the step by step instructions on how to make <em>Pambazos</em></p> 
   <h1> Ingredients</h1>
   <h3> For the Salsa: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 5 to 6 large guajillo peppers  – remove the seeds prior to cooking. 
        If you can’t find guajillo peppers, you can use Chile Negro, California or New Mexico. </li>
        <li> ¼ large onion – white or yellow will work fine.</li>
        <li> 1 large garlic clove peeled </li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon salt – I like to use kosher salt since it has a better flavor profile. </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper – freshly grinded is the best!</li>
   </ul>
   <h3> For the Pambazo:</h3>
   <ul> 
        <li>3 yellow potatoes or 2 large russet potatoes peeled and cut into small cubes. 
            Cutting the potatoes first will speed up the cooking process.</li>
        <li>9 ounces (250 g) beef or soy chorizo.</li>
        <li>4 telera breads cut in half. See below for substitutions.</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>The Toppings</h3>
   <ul>
        <li>2 cups shredded lettuce like romaine or iceberg</li>
        <li>1 cup crumbled cotija or queso fresco</li>
        <li>½ cup Mexican crema</li>
        <li>Mexican pickled onions</li>
        <li>salsa chile de arbol or salsa verde (Optional)</li>
   </ul>
   <h1> Instructions: </h1>
   <h3> Cook the salsa</h3>
   <ol> 
        <li>n a small to medium pot, add the ¼ of a large onion, 
            1 garlic clove and a ½ teaspoon of salt & pepper. 
            Add enough water to cover the onions.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil then lower heat to medium. Cook for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the guajillo chiles making sure they’re completely under the water. 
            Turn off heat and let them sit for 10 minutes or until the chiles are soft and pliable.</li>
        <li>In a blender or food processor, add the chile guajillos, onion, garlic plus 1 ½ cup of the chili water. 
            Blend until smooth and transfer to a bowl.</li>   
   </ol>
   <h3>Make the Chorizo and Potatoes</h3>
   <ol>
        <li>While the chiles are getting hydrated, 
            cook the cubed potatoes in a small pot with enough water to cover the potatoes. 
            Cook for 15 minutes on medium-high heat or until soft. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, add the chorizo and cook over medium high heat for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes to the cooked chorizo 
            and mix well or smash them a little bit in the chorizo a little bit to form a more solid consistency. 
            This will help the chorizo/potato mixture stay inside the sandwich better.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3> Make the Pambazos</h3>
   <ol>
        <li>On a large skillet or comal, add the 2 tablespoons of oil. Heat over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Brush the telera with the salsa or dip it into the salsa to cover the outside of the bread.</li>
        <li>Fry the bread on the skillet or comal until lightly crispy on the outside. Repeat the process for all of the bread.</li>
        <li>Open the telera bread and fill with the chorizo and potato mixture, lettuce, crema, crumbled queso, pickled onion and salsa if using any.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3> Enjoy! Make sure you get some napkins becaue Pambazos can be messy!</h3>
